# smart-greenhouse-system
This project has been designed for surveillance of irrigation systems in farms without the need of manual checking of irrigation systems. The positive part of this project is that, the node used to connect the system to your smart device, also controls the flow of water from the pump and also the timing intervals in between the irrigationÂ cycles.
